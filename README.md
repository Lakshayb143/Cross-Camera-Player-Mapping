## Introduction
This project aims to build a system for tracking and re-identifying football players across two camera angles. It leverages a YOLOv11-based object detection model along with tracking and appearance-based matching strategies to maintain consistent identities across views.

## Modules and Components

| Module        | Purpose                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Preprocessing | Frame extraction, resizing, etc.         |
| Detection     | Run YOLOv11 to detect players            |
| Tracking      | Use DeepSORT/ByteTrack for ID tracking   |
| Features      | Extract ReID features (color histograms, etc.) |
| Matcher       | Match players across views               |
| Visualizer    | Overlay IDs on video and generate output |

---

## Design Decisions
- Implmented various LLD (Low Level Design) techniques to make code simple, clean, modular and scalable.
- Chose YOLOv11 for detection due to pretrained model availability.
- DeepSORT selected for real-time, ID-preserving tracking.
- Re-ID through combination of bounding box crops and color histograms.
- Trade-offs between accuracy and speed discussed here.

## Challenges faced and Edge Cases
- **Occlusions from other players** - Players often overlap or disappear briefly. We can use appearance embeddings
help to reacquire identity.
- **Incomplete Field Overlap** - If a player appears in one view but is out of sight in the other, we can leave it
unmapped 
- **Similar Uniforms** - Teammates look almost identical.
- **Temporary ID Swaps** - If one player overtakes another, trackers sometimes swap IDs.  Mitigate this by
using strong appearance constraints
